my ci/cd/cd automation could look like this:

push on master
    deploy.sh (update the database deployment on test)
    clean.sh (empty the tables)
    tests.sh (run the tests)
    (create a pull request)
pull request accepted
    backup.sh prod (better be safe)
    deploy.sh prod (update the database deployment in prod)
    (brush tests)
